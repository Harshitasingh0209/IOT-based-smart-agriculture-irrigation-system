# 🌱 IoT Based Smart Agriculture Irrigation System

## 📘 Project Overview
This project is a smart irrigation system that uses soil moisture sensors and IoT technology to save water. When the soil moisture level is low, the system automatically turns on the water pump and switches it off once the required moisture is reached. This reduces the need for manual irrigation and improves crop productivity.

## 🛠️ Components Used
- Soil Moisture Sensor  
- NodeMCU (ESP8266 based)  
- Relay Module  
- Water Pump  
- Power Supply

## ⚙️ Working Principle
1. The soil moisture sensor continuously monitors the soil moisture level.  
2. Sensor data is sent to the microcontroller (Arduino/NodeMCU).  
3. When the moisture level falls below the threshold, the microcontroller turns ON the water pump.  
4. The system sends data to a cloud server via Wi-Fi.  
5. Farmers can monitor and control irrigation remotely via a mobile app or web dashboard.  
6. The pump automatically switches OFF when the desired moisture level is reached.

## 🧠 Applications
- Smart irrigation for water conservation in agriculture.  
- Remote monitoring and control of irrigation systems.  
- Suitable for greenhouses and garden maintenance.  
- Educational project demonstrating IoT in agriculture automation.
